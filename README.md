# A Social Blogging Application (API)

Flask is very flexible, it has no certain pattern of a project folder structure.

Our folder structure is app based structure, which means things are grouped by application.

Each folder is an application. This pattern is used by default in Django. It doesn't mean this pattern is better, you need to choose a folder structure depending on your project. And sometime, you will have to use a mixed pattern.
